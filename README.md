# Pyntercom: A MicroPython Project Powering My Actual Apartment Intercom

## Overview

Pyntercom is a MicroPython project that enables smart functionality for a standard apartment intercom system. It allows you to remotely answer calls and unlock the door using [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)(MQTT communication). The system runs on ESP8266 hardware(or any other MicroPython compatible device) and bridges the gap between your traditional intercom and smart home ecosystem.

## Features

- ðŸ“± Remote intercom call detection
- ðŸ”“ Door unlocking via MQTT commands
- ðŸ”Œ Integration with home automation systems
- ðŸ”„ Automatic recovery from WiFi/MQTT disconnections
- ðŸ§ª Built-in test mode for development

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP8266 board (NodeMCU, Wemos D1, etc.)
- Relay module x2 (for controlling door lock and conversation)
- Appropriate power supply
- Connection to intercom system (depends on your specific intercom model)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mihailacusteanu/pyntercom.git
   cd pyntercom
   ```

2. Create your configuration:

   ```bash
   cp src/config/mock_config.py src/config/esp8266_config.py
   ```

3. Edit `src/config/esp8266_config.py` with your WiFi and MQTT credentials.

4. Flash MicroPython to your ESP8266 board (if not already done):

   ```bash
   # Install required tools
   pip install esptool rshell
   
   # Flash MicroPython firmware
   esptool.py --port /dev/your_port erase_flash
   esptool.py --port /dev/your_port write_flash -fm dio 0 firmware.bin
   ```

5. Deploy the code to your ESP8266 using the provided script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy.sh your_port
   ```

## Configuration

Configure the system by editing the following in `src/config/esp8266_config.py`:

```python
WIFI_SSID = "your_wifi_ssid"
WIFI_PASSWORD = "your_wifi_password"
MQTT_USERNAME = "your_mqtt_username" 
MQTT_PASSWORD = "your_mqtt_password"
MQTT_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
MQTT_SERVER = "your_mqtt_server"
```

The GPIO pin configurations are defined in `src/config/core.py` and can be modified if needed:

```python
CALL_DETECTOR_PIN = 14
DOOR_RELAY_PIN = 13
CONVERSATION_RELAY_PIN = 12
```

## Usage

Once deployed to the ESP8266, the system will:

1. Connect to your WiFi network
2. Connect to the MQTT broker
3. Listen for incoming intercom calls
4. Publish call detection messages to MQTT topic `pyntercom/intercom/call_detected`
5. Listen for door unlock commands on MQTT topic `pyntercom/intercom/unlock`

### MQTT Topics

- **Publish**: `pyntercom/intercom/call_detected` - Message published when a call is detected
- **Subscribe**: `pyntercom/intercom/unlock` - Send "open" to this topic to unlock the door

### Testing

Test mode is available for development:

```python
intercom = Intercom()
intercom.run(test_mode=True, max_iterations=10)  # Will run for 10 iterations only
```

## Wiring

Connect your ESP8266 to the intercom system as follows:

1. GPIO 14 (D5) - Input for call detection(speaker of the intercom with proper voltage divider)
2. GPIO 13 (D7) - Output for door unlock relay
3. GPIO 12 (D6) - Output for conversation relay

### Schematic

Below is the wiring schematic for connecting the ESP8266 to your intercom system:

## Development

For local development on your computer:

```bash
./scripts/repl.sh
```

You can also clean Python cache files with:

```bash
./scripts/clean.sh
```

This will start a Python REPL with access to the mock drivers.
